#Javascript
_______________________________

##Examples of my JavaScript code.
A list of all of the files and what they are.
They all have seperate .js files to isolate demos and reduce in filesize (although they're not really that large anyway). Some duplication may occur simply to reduce header requests, preventing sourcing multiple js files.

* ###styled-google-maps.html

A basic styled map using a JSON object and GMaps API V2.

* ###markered-google-maps.html

Another map demo, this time showing markers - the same format as before, JSON object used to feed into script.
