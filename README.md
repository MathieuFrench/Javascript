#Javascript

##Examples of my JavaScript code.
A list of all of the files and what they are.
They all have seperate .js files to isolate demos and reduce in filesize (although they're not really that large anyway). Some duplication may occur simply to reduce header requests, preventing sourcing multiple js files.

### styled-google-maps.html
A basic styled map using a JSON object and GMaps API V2.


### markered-google-maps.html
Another map demo, this time showing markers - the same format as before, JSON object used to feed into script.

### image-slider.html
An adaptation of an adaptation. Originally written to replace a flash based slider, this is script is adapted from that. In use, it is fed by database content (images etc) into a JSON array. The images were relative to pages which sat adjacent to the slider, so to highlight this fact the navigation changed with the slider.
